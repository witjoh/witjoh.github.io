Since my current home brew server park is falling apart, mostly due to pending hardware failures, it is time to migrate to a new setup.
And this makes also a good time to move (almost) everything configuration wise into Puppet.

These pages will describe all the steps I performed to get in the first place my brand new (already EOL) server properly installed with
CentOS7 to act as my 'hypervisor', and to get a puppet master as my first virtual guest running on it.

After that, you can read about my adventures of the migration of my dying setup towards this new environment.

And yes, the goal is to have everything managed by puppet,  have proper automated testing, and keep up with the the fast pace puppet evolves those days.
