Here you will find the documentation of my own home brew IT infrastructure, targeting to an almost overall puppet managed one.
Of course there will be much better and simpler ways, but this is my play and experimenting ground.

The first stage of my new setup will be using Puppet Enterprise, to get more hands-on experience beside the Open-Source Version.
But everything should be applicable to both versions with some little minor adjustments.
